How to create a package
'''''''''''''''''''''''

To create a package for uploading, you need to create a manifest file (required JSON metadata). Example of manifest file::

    {
    "author": "VELES team",
    "configuration": "kanji_config.py",
    "long_description": "Model created for Chinese characters recognition. Dataset was generated by VELES with generate_kanji.py utility. Self-constructing Model. It means that Model can change for any Model (Convolutional, Fully connected, different parameters) in configuration file. Current model - fully-connected Neural Network with MSE loss function.",
    "name": "Kanji",
    "requires": [
        "veles >= 0.9.4",
        "veles.znicz >= 0.9.4"
    ],
    "short_description": "Model created for Chinese characters recognition",
    "workflow": "kanji.py",
    "image": "kanji.png",
    "tags": ["kanji", "self-constructing", "mse", "fully-connected"],
    "files": ["generate_kanji.py", "__init__.py"],
    "snapshots": ["https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/veles.forge/Kanji/kanji_8.1958_2.8874_validation_2.74_train_0.11.4.pickle.gz"]}

To create manifest file use ``veles forge assist`` command from command line. Example::

    cd veles/znicz/samples/DemoKohonen

    PYTHONPATH=../../.. python3 -m veles forge assist kohonen.py
    
    Importing kohonen...
    Scanning for dependencies...
    Package name may not be longer than 64 chars.
    Please enter the desired package name (Kohonen): DemoKohonen
    Please enter a *short* description (<= 140 chars): Kohonen map demo on a simple two dimension dataset.
    The long description will be taken from KohonenWorkflow's docstring.
    Please introduce yourself (e.g., "Ivan Ivanov <i.ivanov@samsung.com>"): VELES team
    Generating DemoKohonen...


After package generation, you can edit manifest file: manifest.json, you can
remove some unnecessary files and add new ones.
Workflow and config will be loaded automatically. To load other files, add them
into `files` field in manifest.json. You can change the picture in the `image` field. And add some tags in the `tags` field.
